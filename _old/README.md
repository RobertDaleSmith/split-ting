Split-Ting
==========

Ting has a great dashboard to show the current billing period and the usages split down by phone numbers. It's great to see who's using what and how much.

For previous billing periods, this handy splitting feature does not show up and it makes it hard for myself to split the bill amongst members of the account.

This form allows one to input the previous billing period's .csv files for Minutes, Megabytes and Messages and provide a breakdown of each phone number's usage and their respective split of the bill.

The best part about this form is that nothing gets uploaded to a server or saved anywhere, it's all done on your browser so no need to worry about data being stolen or given anywhere else! The current form is up at skheath.com/split-ting

Current Issues
--------------

Currently the Megabytes calculations are off by very small numbers which can end up with a bill split that will be off by a few cents compared to the bill total. Working on a fix for this.

Planned Features
----------------

- potentially calculating older pricing plans
